Definition List Extension for Python-Markdown
=============================================

Added parsing of Definition Lists to Python-Markdown.

A simple example:

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
        the family Rosaceae.
    :   An american computer company.

    Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
